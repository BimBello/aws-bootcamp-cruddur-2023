# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Containerized Application (Dockerfile and Docker compose)

After creating a new github repo and  launching it within a new gitpod space
Firstly i installed dockerfile on the backend
On the backend file, I entered the code to run python
I opened the port  for 4567 and ran on my browser and appended /api/activities/home ro my URL to launch the browser


## Adding Dockerfile

Still on the backend, I opened a new Dockerfile and pasted the docker configuration

I typed in pip3 install -r requirements.txt to run flask
